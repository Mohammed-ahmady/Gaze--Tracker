Notes:
- When citing specific figures/tables from the PDF in `enhanced_proposal.md`, include the page and figure number after you extract images (e.g., “Figure 2 in [1], p. 5”).
- If you have full bibliographic details (authors, venue, year), I can update this to a complete citation in IEEE/ACM style.
